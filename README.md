What's my name?
=======

This is a cute little flashcards app I wrote to help legislative
staff match the names to the faces of legislators. It can be easily
modified to generate other kinds of flash cards.  You can see it in
action at <http://whatsmyname.herokuapp.com>.  To use it:

    node server.js
